*Switch* **driver** and navigator roles, now the other partner will make modifications. But first the new driver will need to incorporate the changes already pushed to GitHub. Fetch and merge the changes to your local repository. (git fetch )

[What](http://google.com) is the difference between fetch/merge and pull?

<Make a new branch>, we will make some changes to awesome_page.md. Show off some of your markdown skills. Make something bold, italic, some sort of code block and a link. Add and commit your changes for awesome_page.md, push your branch to github.

Make a pull request like last time. The navigator should review the diff of the request and merge it. You will be using this work flow all the time as a developer!
